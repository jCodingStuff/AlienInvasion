# AlienInvasion
The first Python project made for the book Python Crash Course by Eric Mattens.
You must install "pygame" in order to play this game

You can play this imitation of Space Invaders with the following controls:
  ARROWS = left / right
  SPACE BAR = fire
  P = play (you can click the button as well)
  Q = quit (you can close the window as well)
  
Currently working: keep the high score on a separate file so it's not lost every time the code is interpreted
